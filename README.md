# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, emphasizing the urgent need for advanced methods to enhance early detection and treatment. Machine learning (ML) offers powerful tools for predictive analytics, enabling healthcare professionals to identify patient risk factors with precision and efficiency.
The dataset underwent comprehensive preprocessing to ensure data quality and suitability for classification. Missing values were addressed to maintain dataset integrity, and class balance was preserved to prevent bias in model training and evaluation. The target variable, which indicates the presence or absence of heart disease, was transformed into a categorical factor, facilitating its use in classification algorithms. To prepare for model evaluation, the data was split into training and testing subsets using an 80-20 ratio with stratified sampling. This approach retained the original distribution of the target variable across both subsets, ensuring representative training and testing data.  Four machine learning models were implemented and evaluated for their performance on the dataset. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), a non-parametric algorithm, was optimized using cross-validation. Multiple values of k, including 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11, were tested to identify the optimal configuration. Support Vector Machine (SVM) employed a linear kernel to effectively separate classes in the feature space, demonstrating its robustness in handling binary classification tasks. The Decision Tree model utilized recursive partitioning, creating a hierarchical structure to split the data based on decision rules. This model offered high interpretability through visualization, enabling insights into the classification process. Lastly, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was designed to mimic biological neural networks, featuring a single hidden layer with five neurons. Despite its potential for complex pattern recognition, the ANN's performance was constrained by limited hyperparameter tuning and the relatively small dataset size.  Model evaluation was conducted using accuracy as the primary metric, calculated as the ratio of correctly classified instances to total instances in the test set. This metric provided a clear indication of each model's effectiveness in predicting heart disease based on the given data.
